# Walmart Sales Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores. 
The goal is to help retail businesses accurately forecast demand, reduce stock-outs, and optimize inventory planning.

The dataset contains historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores along with economic and environmental indicators.
